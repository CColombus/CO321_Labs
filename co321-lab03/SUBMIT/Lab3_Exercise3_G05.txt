Maximum available pre-scaler is /1024 ,

    Time taken for single increment with /1024 pre-scaler = 1024/16 microseconds

TIMER0 only has 8bits thus the maximum value it can store is 255.
Adittionaly we need one more increment for the overflow to happen

    Maximum delay by using TIMER0   = 1024/16 * 256
                                    = 16384 microseconds
                                    = 16.384 miliseconds
